# Coding Mate: Python Programming Support for Economics and Social Sciences

**Coding Mate** is a virtual assistant designed to help students learn and apply Python programming in the fields of **economics and social sciences**. It serves as a supportive guide, providing structured assistance to students as they develop coding skills and solve real-world problems in their studies.

## Overview

Coding Mate specializes in:
- **Guiding** students in structuring their code effectively.
- **Reviewing and debugging** to identify and resolve errors.
- **Providing relevant examples and explanations** tailored to student questions.
- **Encouraging best practices** in programming, problem-solving, and critical thinking.

### Purpose

The purpose of Coding Mate is to:
- Help students build a strong foundation in Python programming for economic and social science applications.
- Foster a positive learning environment where students feel supported as they tackle coding challenges.
- Promote critical thinking by guiding students through the problem-solving process, rather than directly solving their assignments.

## Key Features

- **Structured Guidance**: Coding Mate offers assistance in organizing code and structuring logical steps.
- **Error Identification and Debugging**: It helps pinpoint issues in code, suggesting ways to resolve them.
- **Examples and Explanations**: Provides context-specific examples and in-depth explanations to help students grasp complex concepts.
