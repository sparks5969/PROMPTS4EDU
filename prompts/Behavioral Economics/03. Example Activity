# **Activity Handout: Consulting Your Future Self**

### **Exploring Hyperbolic Discounting and Present Bias**

---

### **Introduction**

In this activity, you’ll consult with a 60-year-old future version of yourself—“The Future Me”—to explore how **present bias** and **hyperbolic discounting** can influence decision-making. By interacting with your future self, you’ll gain insight into how present desires may impact your long-term goals and explore ways to make more balanced choices.

### **Key Concepts**

- **Present Bias**: The tendency to overvalue immediate rewards at the expense of future benefits. This bias often leads us to make choices that prioritize instant gratification.
  
- **Hyperbolic Discounting**: A model describing how people tend to prefer rewards that are closer in time, discounting the value of delayed rewards more heavily as the delay increases. This can lead to time-inconsistent preferences, where our current choices conflict with our long-term goals.

### **Activity Steps**

1. **Think of a Decision Scenario**
   - Identify a decision that involves choosing between an immediate reward and a long-term benefit. Examples include:
      - Studying now vs. watching TV
      - Saving money vs. spending it
      - Choosing healthy habits vs. indulgent options

2. **Consult with "The Future Me"**
   - Log in to “The Future Me” GPT and describe your scenario. Share your current thoughts, feelings, and any doubts you may have about the decision.
   - Ask questions like:
     - “What would my 60-year-old self say about choosing [the immediate option]?”
     - “How will I feel in the future if I prioritize immediate satisfaction over long-term benefits?”
     - “What role is present bias playing in my decision?”

3. **Explore Bias Awareness**
   - As you interact with "The Future Me," focus on identifying where **present bias** or **hyperbolic discounting** might be affecting your preference for the immediate option.
   - Use prompts like:
     - “Is present bias influencing my decision? How?”
     - “What strategies can I use to manage this bias and stay focused on my goals?”

4. **Reflect on Your Experience**
   - Use the questions below to reflect on what you learned from interacting with "The Future Me" and how this might impact your future decision-making.

   - Did consulting with "The Future Me" make you reconsider your initial preference? If so, what was the most significant factor that shifted your perspective?

6. **Strategies to Manage Present Bias**  
   - What strategies or insights did you gain to help manage present bias in similar future decisions? How might you remind yourself of these insights when faced with a similar choice?

7. **Takeaways for Future Decisions**  
   - Based on this activity, what have you learned about the role of present bias in decision-making? How might this understanding influence your future choices?
