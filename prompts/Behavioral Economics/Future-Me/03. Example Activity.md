# **Activity: Consulting Your Future Self**

### **Exploring Hyperbolic Discounting and Present Bias**
---
### **Introduction**
-In this activity, you’ll consult with a 60-year-old future version of yourself—“The Future Me”—to explore how **present bias** and **hyperbolic discounting** can influence decision-making. By interacting with your future self, you’ll gain insight into how present desires may impact your long-term goals and explore ways to make more balanced choices.

### **Key Concepts**
- **Present Bias**: The tendency to overvalue immediate rewards at the expense of future benefits. This bias often leads us to make choices that prioritize instant gratification.
- **Hyperbolic Discounting**: A model describing how people tend to prefer rewards that are closer in time, discounting the value of delayed rewards more heavily as the delay increases. This can lead to time-inconsistent preferences, where our current choices conflict with our long-term goals.
